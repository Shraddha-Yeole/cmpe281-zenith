Definition: Everyone is part of the team and communicate face to face daily. Team members work together on everything from requirements to code to create the best solution to our problem that we can together.

Decided to emphasize on continuous and constant communication between team members preferring face-to-face communication. Will be conducting weekly project meetings to achieve this.
