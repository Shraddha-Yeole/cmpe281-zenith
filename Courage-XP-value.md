Courage : Carrying out actions to perform tasks to be done, even though that action may be frightening or difficult.

We are going to focus on below mentioned fear factors during the project development 
1.Fear of changing or improving a piece of code because it could stop working.
2.Fear that some work that should be done would take longer than required and may not meet project deadlines.
3.Fear of improving some process in a team, because it may not work out as expected or there may be strong resistance to the change.

We have discussed the challenges each of us faced during local setup for database models and agreed to implement review comments.
