MongoDB is an open-source document based NoSQL database.  Document Oriented Storage âˆ’ Data is stored in the form of JSON style documents.

Advantages over RDBMS:

MongoDB is a document database in which one collection holds different documents. Number of fields, content and size of the document can differ from one document to another.
MongoDB is easy to scale
Uses internal memory for storing the (windowed) working set, enabling faster access of data.

Key concepts:
1. Database - Database is a physical container for solutions.
2. Document - Document is a set of key-value pair and has dynamic schema. Dynamic schema means documents in the same              collection can have different fields or structure, and common fields in the document may have different types of data.
   A document in MongoDB is equivalent to RDBMS row/tuple. And the fields in document are equal to columns in RDBMS.
3. Collection - Collection is a group of MongoDB documents. A collection in MongoDB is equivalent to RDBMS table.
