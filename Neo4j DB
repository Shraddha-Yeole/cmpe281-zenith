Neo4j DB is an open source graph database developed in Java technology.
It is highly scalable and schema free (NoSQL).

It is a pictorial representation of objects in the form of graphs. 
It has nodes and edges. Edges connects various nodes depending upon the kind of relationships they have. 
We use Cypher Query Language (CQL) to CRUD operations here.
