1. React is not an MVC framework—it's just a view library.
React is a JavaScript library that can be used to describe views (for example, HTML elements) based on some state (which is often in the form of data)**. 
When you’re working with React in a browser, React can mount the described views in the browser’s DOM (Document Object Model)
and automatically update what needs to be updated whenever the original state changes.

2. Instead of MVC and data-binding, a front-end system have a one-way data flow.
The views never change the models directly; they can only read from the models.
React reacts to the data changes in the model. React components will be listening to those changes,
and React will re-render the views efficiently when those changes happen.

3. Instead of REST and having the logic of what data to expose on the server-side, and
instead of managing different end-points for different needs, clients ask the servers 
for exactly what they need. The servers will then parse the clients' questions, and respond with what they asked for.

4. Instead of separating data and views, the data requirement expressed in the view component itself. Since the view knows exactly which
data elements it needs to render, these two are not separate at all.

User Interface: 

1. if we have transitions on the data, we don't have to worry about the user interface—we 
just manage the new state of our data.

2.  we have to change our views if the structure of our data changes. 
For example, when we add a Boolean flag to every product to track whether the product is in stock or not, 
and we want to display the out-of-stock products in gray, this would be a structure transition, not just a data transition. 
Once we account for the new structure for the first time though, updating that new flag becomes just a data transition that we don't have to worry about in the UI.
